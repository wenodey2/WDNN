**2. Data files**

| **Dataset** | **File names** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1 | dataset\_1.csv | Dataset-1 containing wind speed, wind direction, first and second derivatives of wind speed, wind power, first and second derivatives of wind power for 36 wind turbines. |
| #2 | dataset\_2.csv | Dataset-2 containing wind speed, first and second derivatives of wind speed, wind power, first and second derivatives of wind power for 160 wind turbines. |
| #3 | dataset\_3.csv | Dataset-3 containing wind speed, first and second derivatives of wind speed for 100 wind turbines. |
| #4 | dataset\_3\_meta.csv | Dataset-3 meta data containing turbine number, site ID, latitude, and longitude for 100 wind turbines. |

**3. Explanation of the headers of the data files**

| **Header name** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| Time | Timestamp of the data collection. |
| Turbine[t]\_Speed | 10-min average of wind speed observed, in units of m/s. |
| Turbine[t]\_Direction | 10-min average of wind direction observed, in units of degrees. |
| Turbine[t]\_D1Speed | 10-min average of the first derivative of wind speed observed, in units of m/s. |
| Turbine[t]\_D2Speed | 10-min average of the second derivative of wind speed observed, in units of m/s. |
| Turbine[t]\_Power | 10-min average of active power output. |
| Turbine[t]\_D1Power | 10-min average of the first derivative of active power output. |
| Turbine[t]\_D2Power | 10-min average of the second derivative of active power output. |

Where [t] is the number of the turbine. For instance, Turbine5\_Speed is the wind speed measured at Turbine 5.

For dataset_1.csv, [t] range: 1 to 36

For dataset_2.csv, [t] range: 1 to 160

For dataset_3.csv, [t] range: 1 to 100

[d] (dataset) range: 1 to 2 for speed and 1 to 3 for power.

[h] (time horizon) range: 1 to 12 unless otherwise specified.

_Note:_

It is strongly advised to execute the code files in the order in which they are presented in the table above.

Other than the files named _table[x].py_ or _table[x].R_, most of the code files require intensive computation (time and resource). In our research, we executed these files using the computing resources of Texas A&M University High Performance Research Computing (HPRC). Some required at least 48 hours to run in the HPRC using 24G memory.
